# Community

The [dist-sys slack](https://join.slack.com/t/dist-sys/shared_invite/zt-6kt4xd8l-L13ejVQReCTizzS0b_dYOA)
has a `#crdt` channel that you can join.

We are also planning to set up a mailing list...

In person, the annual [PaPoC workshop](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2020/)
is a popular meeting place for CRDT researchers and practitioners.
